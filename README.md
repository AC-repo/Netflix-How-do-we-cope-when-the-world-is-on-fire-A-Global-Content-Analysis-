# 🎬 Netflix & The World: How We Cope Through Stories in Times of Global Crisis

## 📌 Overview

In moments of political unrest, global pandemics, or national trauma, we often turn to stories — not just to be entertained, but to cope, reflect, or escape. This project explores **how streaming content mirrors our social reality** — and at times, offers us a temporary sanctuary from it.

Using Netflix's global catalog, enriched with genre, award, and political context data, this project examines:

* What kind of content performs best across different countries and time periods?
* How do national events like protests, uprisings, elections, or war shape the stories that are told — or streamed?
* What genres become our collective therapy during global or national crisis?
